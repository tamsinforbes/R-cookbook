```


This chapter provides an overview of code examples for table or data frame manipulation (a tidyverse data frame is referred to as a tibble).

One of the main things you will have to do in any R project or RAP project will be manipulating the data that you are using in order to get it into the format you require.

One of the main packages used to manipulate data is the {dplyr} package which we recommend and use throughout this book. The {dplyr} package (and others e.g. {tidyr}) are all part of the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a group of packages developed by Hadley Wickham and others and are all designed to work with each other. See https://www.tidyverse.org/ for more info.

**Tidyverse packages and functions can be combined and layered using the pipe operator `%>%`.**

{dplyr} is built to work with **tidy data**. To find out more about tidy data please look at the following link https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html but the general principles are:

1. Each variables must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell



## Pivot and reshape tables

There will be two examples for pivoting tables provided:

* The {tidyr} package uses the gather/spread functions and is often used to create tidy data
* The {reshape2} package is also a useful package to pivot tables and has added functionality such as providing totals of columns etc.


We want to have the day of the week variable running along the top so each day of the week is its own column.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
# Create smaller dataset for example
road_accidents_small <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Accident_Severity, Day_of_Week) %>%
  dplyr::tally()

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday")

```



**{tidyr} package**

Using the {tidyr} package, gather and spread functions can be used  to pivot the table views:

- **gather** makes wide data longer i.e. variables running along the top can be "gathered" into rows running down.

- **spread** makes long data wider i.e. one variable can be spread and run along the top with each value being a variable.

**Note: Hadley Wickham is bringing out new versions of these packages called pivot_longer and pivot_wider which are not yet available on DfT laptops.**

```{r}
# Pivot table using tidyr package
library(tidyr)
road_accidents_weekdays <- road_accidents_small %>%
  tidyr::spread(Day_of_Week, n)
  
```

With the spread function above you need to first specify the variable you want to spread, in this case `Day_of_Week`, and then the variable that will be used to populate the columns (`n`).

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_weekdays),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, tidyr::spread")

```


The opposite can also be done using the gather function: 

```{r}
# Pivot table using tidyr package
library(tidyr)
road_accidents_gather <- road_accidents_weekdays %>%
  tidyr::gather(`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, key = "weekday", value = "n")


  
```

To use gather, specify which columns you want to be gathered into one column (in this case the individual weekday columns). The `key` is the name of the gathered column, and the `value` is the name of the values.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_gather),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, tidyr::gather")

```

**{reshape2} package**

Again, this has two functions which can be used to pivot tables:

- **melt** makes wide data longer 

- **dcast** makes long data wider


```{r}
# Pivot table using reshape2 package
library(reshape2)
road_accidents_weekdays2 <- 
  reshape2::dcast(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity ~ 
                    Day_of_Week, value.var = "n")
  
```

With the `dcast` function above, after stating the name of the data frame, you need to specify the variable(s) you want in long format (multiple variables seperated by "+"), in this case Accident_Severity, and then the wide format variable(s) are put after the tilda (again multiple seperated by "+"). The `value.var` argument specifies which column will be used to populate the new columns, in this case it is n.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_weekdays2),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, reshape2::dcast")

```

If you want to create sums and totals of the tables this can also be done using {reshape2}. For example, taking the original table, we want to pivot it and sum each severity to get the total number of accidents per day.

```{r}
# Pivot table using reshape2 package
library(reshape2)
road_accidents_weekdays3 <- 
reshape2::dcast(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity ~ Day_of_Week,
value.var = "n", sum, margins = "Accident_Severity")
  
```

In this example, we use the `margins` argument to specify what we want to combine to create totals. So we want to add all the accident severity figures up for each weekday. Before using `margins` you need to specify how the margins are calculated, in this case we want a `sum`. Alternative options are to calculate the length, i.e. the number of rows.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_weekdays3),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday plus totals, reshape2::dcast")

```




The opposite can also be done using the `melt` function.

```{r}
# Pivot table using reshape2 package
library(reshape2)
road_accidents_melt <- reshape2::melt(road_accidents_weekdays2, id.vars = "Accident_Severity",
                                      measure.vars = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"),
                                      variable.name = "Day_of_Week", value.name = "n")
  
```

For the `melt` function you need to specify:


`id.vars` = "variables to be kept as columns"

`measure.vars` = c("variables to be created as one column")

`variable.name` = "name of created column using the measure.vars"

`value.name` = "name of value column"


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_melt),
caption = "Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, reshape2::melt")
```


## Dropping and selecting columns

Use the {dplyr} select function to both select and drop columns.

**Select columns**

```{r}
road_accidents_4_cols <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::select(acc_index, Accident_Severity, Date, Police_Force)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_4_cols),
caption = "Four columns from road accidents 2017")
```


**Drop columns**

 Note that to drop columns the difference is putting a "-" in front of the variable name.
 
```{r}
road_accidents_3_cols <- road_accidents_4_cols %>%
  dplyr::select(-Police_Force)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_3_cols),
caption = "Three columns from road accidents 2017")
```
 


## Filtering data

Use the {dplyr} filter function to filter data.

This example filters the data for slight severity accidents (accident severity 3).

```{r}
road_accidents_slight <- road_accidents_4_cols %>%
  dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_slight),
caption = "Slight severity road accidents 2017")
```

To filter multiple conditions:

And operator
```{r}
road_accidents_filter <- road_accidents_4_cols %>%
  dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3 & Police_Force == 4)
```

Or operator
```{r}
road_accidents_filter2 <- road_accidents_4_cols %>%
  dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3 | Accident_Severity == 2)
```

**Note: filtering with characters must be wrapped in "quotation marks" e.g:**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
road_accidents_filter3 <- road_accidents %>%
dplyr::filter(`Local_Authority_(Highway)` == "E09000010")

```
Also note that in the above example the variable is quoted in back ticks (`). This is because some variable names confuse R due to brackets and numbers and need to be wrapped in back ticks so R knows that everything inside the back ticks is a variable name.

## Group data 

Use the {dplyr} group_by function to group data. This works in a similar manner to "GROUP BY" in SQL.

The below example groups the data by accident severity and weekday, and creates totals for each group using the "tally" function.

```{r}
# Create grouped data set with counts
road_accidents_small <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Accident_Severity, Day_of_Week) %>%
  dplyr::tally()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small),
caption = "Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday")
```

## Order data

Use the {dplyr} arrange function to order data. This works in a similar manner to "ORDER BY" in SQL.

This example orders the data by date and number of casualties.

```{r include=FALSE}
road_acc_7 <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::sample_n(7)

```


```{r}
# Order data by date and number of casualties
road_accidents_ordered <- road_acc_7 %>%
  dplyr::select(acc_index, Accident_Severity, Police_Force, Number_of_Casualties, Date) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Date, Number_of_Casualties)
  
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_ordered),
caption = "Road accidents 2017 ordered by date and number of casualties")
```

## Get counts of data

To get counts for groups of data, the {dplyr} tally function can be used in conjunction with the {dplyr} group by function. This groups the data into the required groups and then tallys how many records are in each group.

```{r}
# Create grouped data set with counts
road_accidents_small <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Accident_Severity, Day_of_Week) %>%
  dplyr::tally()
```

The above example creates groups by accident severity and weekday and counts how many accidents are in each group (one row equals one accident therefore the tally is counting accidents).

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small),
caption = "Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday")
```



## Combine tables

When combining data from two tables there are two ways to do this in R:

* Bind the tables by basically either appending the tables on the rows or columns
* Join the tables using the {dplyr} version of SQL joins

**Binding tables**

Binding tables is mainly done to append tables by creating more rows, however tables can also be bound by adding more columns. Although it is recommended to use the {dplyr} join functions to combine columns (see 5.6).

```{r include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# create three tables for example
accidents_1 <- dplyr::filter(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity == 1)
accidents_2 <- dplyr::filter(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity == 2)
accidents_3 <- dplyr::filter(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity == 3)

```

Here are three tables, one shows data for accident severity of 1, one for accident severity of 2, and one for accident severity of 3.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(accidents_1, caption = "Number of fatal road accidents in 2017, by weekday")
knitr::kable(accidents_2, caption = "Number of serious injury road accidents in 2017, by weekday")
knitr::kable(accidents_3, caption = "Number of slight injury road accidents in 2017, by weekday")

```

To combine these tables we can use the bind_rows function from the {dplyr} package. Use bind_rows when you want to append the tables underneath one another to make one longer table, i.e. you want to add more rows.

**Ensure that the column names for each table are exactly the same in each table.**

```{r}
# combine tables using bind_rows
library(dplyr)

all_accidents <- accidents_1 %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows(accidents_2, accidents_3)
  
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(all_accidents, caption = "Road accident data 2017, bind_rows")

```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# create two tables for example
road_acc_1 <- head(dplyr::select(road_accidents, acc_index, Police_Force, Accident_Severity))
road_acc_2 <- head(dplyr::select(road_accidents, acc_index, Date, Day_of_Week))

```


## Joining tables


Joins in R can be done using {dplyr}. This is generally to combine columns of data from two tables:


```{r}
# combine tables using left join
library(dplyr)

all_accidents_cols_join <- road_acc_1 %>%
  dplyr::left_join(road_acc_2, by = "acc_index")
```

This uses the same principles as SQL, by specifying what the tables should be joined on using the **by =** argument. 


{dplyr} has all the usual SQL joins for example, `inner_join`, `full_join`, `right_join`. All of these are used in the same way as the left join example above.

Another useful join for data manipulation is an `anti_join`. This provides all the data that is not in the joined table. For example, the below snapshot of a table displays road accident totals broken down by accident severity and weekday:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small, caption = "Road accident data 2017 by accident severity and weekday"))

```

I am interested in creating two sub-groups of this data, a table for all accidents on a Monday (weekday 2), and all other accidents.

First, I get the **Monday** data using the {dplyr} filter function (see 5.3).

```{r include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# create filtered Monday table for example

accidents_monday <- dplyr::filter(road_accidents_small, Day_of_Week == 2)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(accidents_monday, caption = "Road accident data 2017 on a Monday by accident severity"))

```

Then, I can use an `anti-join` to create a table which has all of the data that is not in the above table:

```{r}
# create table of all rows not in the joined table
library(dplyr)

all_accidents_not_monday <- road_accidents_small %>%
  dplyr::anti_join(accidents_monday, by = c("Accident_Severity", "Day_of_Week"))
```

The above code takes the initial table we want to get our data from (road_accidents_small) and anti joins accidents_monday. This says, "get all the rows from road_accidents_small that are not in accidents_monday". Again, note the need to specify what the join rows would be joined and compared by.


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(all_accidents_not_monday, caption = "Road accident data 2017 not on a Monday by accident severity")
```

## Select specific columns in a join

Doing a join with {dplyr} will join all columns from both tables, however sometimes not all columns from each table are needed.

Let's look at some previous tables again:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(road_acc_1, caption = "Police force and accident severity information for accidents")
knitr::kable(road_acc_2, caption = "Date and weekday information for accidents")
```

Let's say we want **acc_index** and **Police_Force** from the first table, and **Date** from the second table.

```{r}
# select specific columns from each table and left join
library(dplyr)

road_acc_3 <- road_acc_1 %>%
  dplyr::select(acc_index, Police_Force) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(select(road_acc_2, acc_index, Date), by = "acc_index")
```

The above code takes the first table and uses the `select` statement to select the required columns from the first table. 

Then within the `left_join` command, to select the data from the second table, you again add the `select` statement.

**Note: you will need to select the joining variable in both tables but this will only appear once**

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(road_acc_3, caption = "Police force and Date information for specific accidents")
```

## Sum rows or columns
These solutions use the base R functions rather than {dplyr}.

### Sum rows

To sum across a row:

```{r}
# sum across a row 
road_accidents_weekdays$rowsum <- rowSums(road_accidents_weekdays, na.rm = TRUE) 
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(road_accidents_weekdays, caption = "Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday")
```

To sum across specific rows:

```{r}
# sum across specific rows 
road_accidents_weekdays$alldays <- road_accidents_weekdays$`1` + road_accidents_weekdays$`2`+
                                    road_accidents_weekdays$`3`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`4`+
                                    road_accidents_weekdays$`5`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`6`+
                                    road_accidents_weekdays$`7`
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(road_accidents_weekdays[,-9], caption = "Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday")
```

### Sum columns
 
To sum columns to get totals of each column, ***note this will appear as a console output not in a data object***:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# sum columns
colSums(road_accidents_weekdays, na.rm = TRUE) 
```


To get the totals of each column as a row in the data:

```{r}
# create total column
road_accidents_weekdays <- road_accidents_weekdays %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals("row")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(road_accidents_weekdays[,-9:-10], caption = "Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday")
```


{reshape2} can also be used to get column totals when pivoting a table (See 5.1).

## Replace NAs or other values

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Create dataset for example with nas (need to change -1 value to na as this is how NAs are represented in the road accident open data)

# create nas
road_accidents_na <- road_accidents %>%
  dplyr::na_if(-1)

# get smaller data set for example
road_accidents_na <- road_accidents_na %>%
  head(n = 7) %>%
  dplyr::select(acc_index, `1st_Road_Class`, `2nd_Road_Class`, Junction_Control)

```

To replace all NAs in one column (Junction Control column) with a specific value:

```{r}
library (tidyr)
# replace all NAs with value -1
road_accidents_na$Junction_Control <- road_accidents_na$Junction_Control %>%
  tidyr::replace_na(-1)

```

**Note: To replace NA with a character the character replacement must be wrapped in "quotation marks"**

To replace all NAs in a data frame or tibble:

```{r}

# replace all NAs with value -1
road_accidents_na <- road_accidents_na %>%
  replace(is.na(.), -1)
  

```

To replace values with NA, specify what value you want to be replaced with NA using the na_if function:

```{r}

# create nas
road_accidents_na <- road_accidents_na %>%
  dplyr::na_if(-1)
  

```
**Note: to only create NAs in a specific column specify the column name in a similar manner to the first example in this section.**

To replace values:
```{r}

# replace 1st_road_class 
road_accidents_na <- road_accidents_na %>%
  dplyr::mutate(`1st_Road_Class` = dplyr::case_when(`1st_Road_Class` == 3 ~ "A Road",
                                      TRUE ~ as.character(`1st_Road_Class`)))
  

```

The case_when function is similar to using CASE WHEN in SQL. 

The TRUE argument indicates that if the values aren't included in the case_when then they should be whatever is after the tilda (~)  i.e. the equivalent of the ELSE statement in SQL.

The "as.character" function says that everything that in `1st_Road_Class` isn't 3 should be kept as it is, this could be replaced by an arbitrary character or value e.g. "Other". This would make everything that is not a 3, coded as "Other". 

You can have multiple case_when arguments for multiple values, they just need to be seperated with a comma. Multiple case_when statements for different variables can be layered using the pipe operator `%>%`.


## Reordering rows/columns

### Reordering rows

Rows can be reordered by certain variables using the {dplyr} arrange function with examples in the **4.5 Order data** sub-chapter of this book. This will order the data in ascending order by the variables quoted. To order rows in descending order the ``desc()`` command can be used within the arrange function.

```{r}
# Order data by date and number of casualties
road_accidents_ordered_desc <- road_acc_7 %>%
  dplyr::select(acc_index, Accident_Severity, Police_Force, Number_of_Casualties, Date) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Date), Number_of_Casualties)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_ordered_desc),
caption = "Road accidents 2017 ordered by date (descending) and number of casualties")
```

### Reordering columns

Use the {dplyr} select statement to reorder columns, where the order of the variables quoted represents the order of the columns in the table.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_4_cols),
caption = "Four columns from road accidents 2017")
```

To reorder this table we do:

```{r}
table_reordered <- road_accidents_4_cols %>%
  dplyr::select(Accident_Severity, Date, acc_index, Police_Force)
```



## Creating new variables

The {dplyr} mutate function can be used to create new variables based on current variables or other additional information. 

For example, to create a new variable which is speed limit in km:

```{r}
road_acc_km <- road_acc_7 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(speed_km = Speed_limit * 1.6)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(road_acc_km <- dplyr::select(road_acc_km, acc_index, Police_Force, Speed_limit, speed_km)),
caption = "Road accidents by km/h")
```

## Summarising data

The {dplyr} summarise function can be used to summarise data (mean, median, sd, min, max, n_distinct). See https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html for more examples.

For example, to get the mean number of accidents for each weekday:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small),
caption = "Road accidents 2017, by severity and weekday")
```

The group by function is used with the summarise function to specify what groups the mean will be applied to, in this case weekday. 

```{r}
road_acc_mean <- road_accidents_small %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Day_of_Week) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(n))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_acc_mean),
caption = "Mean number of accidents in 2017, by weekday")
```


## Look up tables

Aside from importing a separate lookup data file into R, named vectors can be used as lookup tables.

For example, to assign accident severity values with labels, named vectors can be used (**note: numbers must also be in quotation marks**):

```{r}
lookup_severity <- c("1" = "Fatal", "2" = "Serious", "3" = "Slight")
```

To convert the data and create a label variable (**note: the Accident_Severity variable values can be replaced with the lookup values by changing the name of the variable on the left to Accident_Severity**):

```{r}
road_accidents_small$Accident_Severity_label <- lookup_severity[road_accidents_small$Accident_Severity]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(road_accidents_small),
caption = "Road accidents 2017, by severity and weekday")
```
