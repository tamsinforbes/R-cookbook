## Vectors

### Types {#vector-types}

There are four main atomic vector types that you are likely to come across
when using R^[technically there are more, see 
https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors]; **logical** (`TRUE` 
or `FALSE`), *double* (`3.142`), *integer* (`2L`) and *character* (`"Awesome"`)

```{r}
v1 <- TRUE
typeof(v1)
v1 <- FALSE
typeof(v1)

v2 <- 1.5
typeof(v2)
v2 <- 1
typeof(v2)

# integer values must be followed by an L to be stored as integers
v3 <- 2
typeof(v3)
v3 <- 2L
typeof(v3)

v4 <- "Awesome"
typeof(v4)
```

As well as the atomic vector types you will often encounter two other vector
types; **factors** and **Dates**.  

Factor vectors are used to represent categorical data.  They are actually
integer vectors with two additional attributes, levels and class.  At this
stage it is not worth worrying to much about what attribute are.  For the moment
just understand that, for factors, the levels attribute gives the possible 
categories and, combined with the integer values, works much like a lookup 
table.  The `class` attribute is just "factor".

```{r}
ratings <- factor(c("good", "bad", "bad", "amazing"))
typeof(ratings)
attributes(ratings)
```

Date vectors are just double vectors with an additional class attribute set as
"Date".  

**Note - The following borrows directly from Hadley's Advanced R site
so we need to attribute appropriately and use correct licence**

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
typeof(today)
attributes(today)
```

The value of the double (which can be seen by stripping the class), represents
the number of days since "1970-01-01"^[This special date is known as the Unix 
Epoch]:

```{r}
date <- as.Date("1970-02-01")
unclass(date)
```

### Conversion between atomic vector types

Converting between the atomic vector types is done using the `as.character`, 
`as.integer`, `as.logical` and `as.double` functions.

```{r}
value <- 1.5
as.integer(value)
as.character(value)
as.logical(value)
```

Where it is not possible to convert a value you will get a warning message

```{r}
value <- "z"
as.integer(value)
```

When combining different vector types, coercion will obey the following 
hierarchy: character, double, integer, logical.

```{r}
typeof(c(9.9, 3L, "pop", TRUE))
typeof(c(9.9, 3L, TRUE))
typeof(c(3L, TRUE))
typeof(TRUE)
```
